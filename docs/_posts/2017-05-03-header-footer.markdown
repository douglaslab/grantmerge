Version 2 of GrantMerge is now available. It supports insertion of a PHS 398 header and footer:

![](/grantmerge/images/posts/170503_gm-v2.png)

Here is what the output looks like:

![](/grantmerge/images/posts/170503_example-v2.jpg)

You still need to manually edit the highlighted regions in the header ("Lastname, Firstname") and footer ("No budgetary or scientific overlap").
