Grant writing is nothing if not endlessly reformatting the same information to put into different documents. I wouldn't be surprised if it accounts for 5% of the global research budget.

I decided to make another attempt at streamlining this process by building a simple add-on for Google Sheets. GrantMerge is basically a [mail merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_merge), except instead of envelope labels with names and addresses, we're filling out Current and Pending Support with budget periods and annual direct costs.

Famous last words: Google docs has been around for over a decade, so it's probably safe to build stuff on top of it now?
